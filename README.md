---
- ✨ I'm a third-year joint PhD. student at USTC and Shanghai AI Lab. I passionate about **effective and efficient inference** for AIGC.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on **speculative decoding**, a promising technique for acclerating LLM inference.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning some techniques for better inference performance.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on relative topics, mainly about inference techniques.

 If you think my dog Luca is very cute, please give me a star!
