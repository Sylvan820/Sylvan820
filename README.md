 <!-- About section -->

---
- ✨ I'm a Direct Ph.D. student at **Zhejiang University** and a Research Intern at **Qwen**. I'm deeply passionate about **MLSys, AI Infrastructure, and Edge Computing**.
- 🔭 I’m currently focused on **Speculative Decoding**, exploring techniques like breaking the acceleration limits of LLM inference.
- 🌱 I’m constantly learning and building robust systems for more effective and efficient AI inference.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on topics related to **LLM inference acceleration, Speculative parallelism, and Machine learning systems**.
- ⚡ Outside of research, I enjoy playing basketball, video games, and photography.
